# Course_CMNP

This is the master code set for creating the solution figures belonging to the course "Computational Modeling of Neuronal Plasticity" created by Florence Kleberg and Prof. Jochen Triesch, and released online for the INCF TrainingSpace open-access learning portal.

****** Important information!! ******

This code is esentially the 'solution key' to this course. Since the goal of the course is to empower you by creating your own neuronal model by programming from scratch, you will not learn much by simply downloading and running this code unless you have tried to make it work with your own code first. For the best learning experience, the code should therefore only be viewed by supervisors or tutors who support students in this course, or by independent students who have tried their best to get the solutions by themselves and wish to either verify the accuracy of their work at the end of the course, or get unstuck from a challenging exercise. 

This code does not constitute the course itself. The course materials, such as the exercises, text and videos, are found on the INCF TrainingSpace. 

******

The master code set is divided into 5 parts, which correspond to the different levels in the course:

1. The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron
2. Adaptation in Spiking Behaviour
3. Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
4. Homeostasis
5. Short-Term Plasticity (STP)

The levels each contain 2 to 4 learning units. The master code is given separately for each unit, even if some files are identical between some units, such as the Euler integration. Running the code should result in the solution image or images, given at the end of each unit. Due to random number generation, for some units this code will generate a different but essentially equivalent result as the one on the course page itself.

Over time, additional changes in the code for code quality may be committed by myself or my colleagues.
Thanks for checking this repository, and happy teaching/learning!
